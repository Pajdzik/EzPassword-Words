all fur coat and no knickers
antihypertriacylglycerolemia
appressed-fibrillose-striate
as easy as rolling off a log
bright eyed and bushy tailed
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
built like a brick shithouse
built like a shit brickhouse
caught with one's pants down
cold as a well-digger's arse
counterimmunoelectrophoretic
dry as a dead dingo's donger
dumber than a bag of hammers
few cards shy of a full deck
German Democratic Republican
innocent as the child unborn
like feeding time at the zoo
lit up like a Christmas tree
nervous as a whore in church
not worth writing home about
oligoasthenoteratozoospermic
penny wise and pound foolish
penny-wise and pound-foolish
phony as a three-dollar bill
screwed, glued, and tattooed
thin as a yard of pump water
useful as a chocolate teapot
what-you-see-is-what-you-get
