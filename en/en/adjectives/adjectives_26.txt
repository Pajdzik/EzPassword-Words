academically disadvantaged
afraid of one's own shadow
antibutyrylcholinesterasic
backward in coming forward
big enough and ugly enough
black as Newgate's knocker
black as the ace of spades
black over Bill's mother's
born on the Fourth of July
caught with the cookie jar
comfortable as an old shoe
de bonis non administratis
deceptively misdescriptive
drunk as a fiddler's bitch
dumber than a box of rocks
electromagnetohydrodynamic
ethnopsychopharmacological
ethylenediaminetetraacetic
full of the joys of spring
gravitationally challenged
knee-deep in the Big Muddy
knee-high to a grasshopper
lower than a snake's belly
neuroimmunopharmacological
neuropsychopharmacological
not worth a brass farthing
not worth a plugged nickel
off like a bride's nightie
plain as Dunstable highway
radioimmunoelectrophoretic
rare as a four-leaf clover
straight from the shoulder
straight-from-the-shoulder
too big for one's breeches
too big for one's britches
Trinidadian and Tobagonian
uvulopalatopharyngoplastic
wild as a Tuckernuck steer
worth one's weight in gold
worth one's weight in salt
